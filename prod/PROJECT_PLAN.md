# Voice Agent Development Plan using LiveKit

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a voice agent system using LiveKit for real-time communication between a Python backend agent and a React frontend. The system will run locally with LiveKit server deployed in Docker.

## Components
1. **Python Voice Agent**: Backend service that processes audio and responds
2. **LiveKit Server**: Running in Docker for real-time communication
3. **React Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the voice agent

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Docker & LiveKit Server Setup
- **Remove existing Docker installation (if needed)**
- **Install Docker Desktop**
- **Pull and configure LiveKit server**
  - Create docker-compose.yml for LiveKit server
  - Configure environment variables
  - Generate API keys

### 2. Python Voice Agent Development
- **Setup Python environment**
  - Create virtual environment using uv
  - Install required packages (LiveKit SDK, audio processing libraries)
- **Implement agent functionality**
  - Audio processing
  - LiveKit connection
  - Voice agent logic
  - Integration with language models

### 3. React Frontend Development
- **Setup React application**
  - Create basic React app
  - Install LiveKit React SDK
- **Implement UI components**
  - Audio recording and playback
  - Connection status
  - Agent interaction interface

### 4. Integration and Testing
- **Connect all components**
  - Ensure consistent LiveKit configuration
  - Test end-to-end communication
- **Optimize performance**
  - Reduce latency
  - Improve audio quality

## Configuration Details
- **LiveKit URL**: wss://localhost:7880
- **Room name**: voice-agent-room
- **Agent identity**: agent
- **Frontend identity**: user

## Development Timeline
1. Environment Setup: 1 day
2. Python Agent Development: 2-3 days
3. React Frontend Development: 1-2 days
4. Integration and Testing: 1 day
